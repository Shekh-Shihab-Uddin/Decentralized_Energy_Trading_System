Created a unique #energy #trading #dapp using #ethereum #blockchain , #expressjs , #react ,  #nodes ( #bern ) #web3 etc. The main manager of this system is the owner or deployer. Only or any agent set by him can register deregister any producer and consumer. Then the producer and the consumer can transact energy between them with the exchange of #ether . Used #node server for role-verification. Only specified user have access to particular pages. e.g. Only owner or the agent have access to "Register" page, Producer has access to "Bid Energy page" etc. But anyone can visit the Homepage and Record page. It is also visible online on : https://deenergytrade.netlify.app . (N.B. Due to issues in netlify may lag sometimes)

— First created and tested the contract in #remix IDE

— Then Performed the #smartcontract #testing using #truffle framework's contract() method.

— It is deployed on #sepolia #testnet .

— The background server is created using #nodejs , #expressjs and hosted on render.com (https://energy-dapp.onrender.com )

— I created the frontend using #reactjs library and hosted it on netlify.com finally connected them all to bring online and fully functional.

— Used #web3Js to communicate between the smart-contract and the front-end #metamask as crypto-wallet etc.
